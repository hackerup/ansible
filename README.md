# Offensive Ansible
## Overview
This repository contains a number of Ansible playbooks (scripts for non-Ansible folks) that can be used to configure remote devices, install offensive security tools, and setup various types of infrastructure (phishing, web redirectors, mail servers, C2 servers).

Ansible is a "software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool."  It runs on a Unix system, and can be used to remotely manage Unix and Windows systems. Ansible is only installed on the "Server" system, it does not install Ansible agents on the client/target systems.

These playbooks are meant to be modular, they can be used independently or in combnination with each other. The playbooks might not be one size fits all, but thankfully Ansible is pretty easy to understand and you can easily swap, add, or remove tasks to fit your needs. The Ansible tasks use "modules" that are kind of like wrappers for OS commands, so the playbooks feel very much like writing a bash or batch script executing serial OS commands. If there isn't a module to do what you want you can just perform actions using the "command line."

### Requirements:
 * Python 2.7 is required to be installed on the client/target:
   * apt-get install python -y
 * SSH server running on the client/target

**Configure A records for primary domain and subdomains before running these scripts. They should all temporarily point to the Web Redirctor server. The domains need to be established in DNS in order for letsencrypt to obtain SSL certs, or else it will error**

### How to get started:
#### These instructions are to be implemented on your Ansible Server
* sudo apt install ansible
* sudo apt install whois
* Generate a password hash for the new unpriv user, annotate hash for use in .yml files:
  * or mkpasswd -m sha-512
* Disable host key checking:
  * sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
* Add Client names and IPs to Ansible "hosts" file:
  * sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts 
  * Must match names under the "hosts" area in ansible scripts: i.e. mail, core, redirector, drone
* sudo apt-get install sshpass
* Generate ssh keypairs for Clients, annotate paths for .yml files:
  * ssh-keygen
* Modify variables in the "vars" section of each Ansible script. Data that needs to be modified is contained between angle brackets (e.g. <variable_name>) need to be modified.
  * If you are running scripts in series to build a certain infrastructure concept (i.e. phishing server + mail server + web redirector), you will not know all of the variables up front as some of the required information is dependent on a prior script executing. For example, ghostPhish.yml requires the SSL certs generated by webRedirector.yml.
* Make sure to change Hostname on VPS
* Make sure to setup DNS records before running the redirectorSetup.yml script, letsencrypt needs the records to be established in order to make SSL certs. 
  * **ALL RECORDS NEED TO INITIALLY POINT TO REDIRCTOR IP**
  * postfix.yml has an example of how the records should look.
  * Ensure that the hostnames resolve in DNS before moving forward.

### Execution:
* Run initial secureSetup.yml Ansible script to configure Clients in a secure state:
  * sudo ansible-playbook --ask-pass -u root secureSetup.yml
* Run secondary Ansible scripts to configure Client for various purposes:
  * sudo ansible-playbook -u <Client_unprivileged_user_name> <script_name>.yml --key-file <path/sshkey_rsa> --ask-become-pass
  
### SSH with public keys:
  * ssh USER@IP -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  
### For when you rebuild a Client and need to delete old keys:
  * sudo ssh-keygen -f "/root/.ssh/known_hosts" -R clientIp

### How to setup GoPhish infrastructure:
 1. Run secureSetup.yml on Core Server (server that GoPhish is installed on), Web Redirector, and Mail Server
 2. Run webRedirector.yml on Web Redirector
 3. Run mailServer.yml on Mail Server
 4. Run GoPhish.yml/GhostPhish.yml on Core
